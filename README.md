docker-no-ip
============

This is a simple Docker container for running the [No-IP2](http://www.noip.com/) dynamic DNS update script. 
It will keep your domain.ddns.net DNS alias up-to-date as your home IP changes.
It is based on the work done by coppit (https://github.com/coppit/no-ip). 
Small modifications were made to make it work on a raspberry pi. You can change the FROM line in the Dockerfile
to make it run on a raspberry pi or other machine.

Usage
-----

Build:

  `docker build --rm=true -t tgiesela/no-ip` 
	or 
  `../build.sh`

Run:

  `docker run --name=noip -d -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime -v /config/dir/path:/config tgiesela/no-ip`
	or
  `../run.sh`

Edit the file noip.conf, adding your username (email), password, and domains. Then rerun the command.

When starting the container for the first time, a binary config file /config/dir/path/no-ip2.generated.conf 
will be generated. Please do not edit this file, as it is used by the noip2 agent.

To check the status, run `docker logs noip`.
